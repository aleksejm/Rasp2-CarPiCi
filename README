So! How to install it:

1. You need Raspbian Wheeze!!! image (can take from here http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2015-05-07/)
2. Install Wheeze on Your SD card (follow the instruction from !1.2.1! https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B__Rs5JF53-kNkZOOFVDVDBvb2s/edit)
3. If You follow the instruction :) You will get my modified version of CarPC.

What are the different:
Changed all logos and background to Lexus;
Added russian translation (English still availableble);
Added in interface buttons: reboot, reloadskin, settings, USB unmount and mount;
Updated Textures.xbt (modified with Lexus logos);
Added Power LED indicator;
Hard Reset/turnOn button;
Added RTC real time clock (need connect RTC module);
Chip temp controll with automated fan;
Added automated power off then engine turned off and the key teked out (bonus PowerOFF schematic);
Some future plans...

The starting idea is teked from (special thanks):
